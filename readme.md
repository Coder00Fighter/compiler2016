# Compiler 2016

This is a toy compiler for the course [Compiler 2016](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/wiki/Compiler_2016) at ACM Class, SJTU.

You can refer to [my presentation slides](https://github.com/abcdabcd987/compiler2016/blob/master/design/presentation.pdf) to know something about this compiler and also what I've learnt during the course.

When debugging this compiler, I wrote another project [LLIRInterpreter](https://github.com/abcdabcd987/LLIRInterpreter) which reads text IR and does interpretation.
